Huge thanks to Modding by Kaupenjoe for the fantastic tutorials that helped me make my mod!
Thank you to the creators at How to Make Everything for a lot of the information I used to make this mod as realistic as possible.

All textures by music_crafter, the mod author.
Some textures drew inspiration from other sources, including:

Flint tools inspired by the textures used for DruidCraft's bone tools, done by VulpTheHorseDog (as far as I'm aware).
Cotton crops draw heavily on Tomato crops from Farmer's Delight, art by vectorwing.
